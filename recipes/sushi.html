    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>Sushi is a popular Japanese dish made from seasoned rice with fish, egg, or vegetables. 
       A sushi roll is shaped inside a thin sheet of seaweed. Sushi comes from a Japanese word meaning "sour rice," and it's
       the rice that's at the heart of sushi, even though most Americans think of it as raw fish.</p>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul>
                <li>⅓ cup Japanese sushi-style rice</li>
                <li>⅓ cup water</li>
                <li>2 ¼ teaspoons rice vinegar</li>
                <l>2 ¼ teaspoons white sugar</l>    
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
        <ol>
                <li>Rinse rice in a strainer until water runs clear.</li>
                <li>Combine rice and water in a saucepan; bring to a boil. 
                Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Combine rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over low heat; stir until sugar is dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. 
                Pour over rice; stir until rice cools and looks dry.</li>
                <li>Mix tuna, mayonnaise, chile oil, sesame oil, sriracha sauce, and green onion in a bowl with a fork, mashing to break up some of the chunks. 
                Leave a few chunks intact for texture.</li>
                <li>Cover a bamboo sushi rolling mat with plastic wrap. Lay 1 nori sheet, shiny-side down, on the mat. Spread a thin layer of rice over the nori. Layer avocado slices across the rice. Flip nori sheet so avocado is against the mat. 
                Spread a generous layer of tuna mixture 3/4 of the way down the back of the nori; top with cucumber matchsticks.</li>
                <li>Roll up sushi using the rolling mat, tucking in ends with the plastic wrap. Remove plastic wrap and place sushi roll on a plate. 
                Repeat with remaining nori, rice, avocado, tuna mixture, and cucumber.</li>
