    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>Buffalo wing, also called hot wing, chicken wing, or wing, deep-fried unbreaded 
        chicken wings or drumsticks coated with a vinegar-and-cayenne-pepper hot sauce mixed with butter. 
        They commonly are served with celery and a blue cheese 
        dipping sauce, which acts as a cooling agent for the mouth.</p>

    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup tomato-based hot pepper sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>


        <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor or indoor grill to a high heat. Lightly grease the grill.</li>
        <li>Season wings with garlic powder and ground black pepper. Cook wings on the preheated grill until they are very crispy. Turn the wings frequently as they will burn easily. </li>
        <li>While the wings are grilling, in a large bowl, combine both hot sauces with garlic powder, Parmesan cheese and melted butter.</li>
        <li>When the wings are finished cooking, place them in the large bowl of hot sauce mixture and stir until they are coated.</li>
